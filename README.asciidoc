= ged2dot, a GEDCOM to Graphviz converter

== What's the problem the tool solves?

`ged2dot` is a script that takes a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM[GEDCOM]
file and tries to visualize it using http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz]'s `dot`
tool. The basic idea is that you can map individuals to graph nodes and
families to graph edges, then `dot` takes care of the rest. What's unique about
`ged2dot` is that it allows more than showing ancestors and descendants of a
single individual (what you can easily do with random family editor software).

== Scenarios

Currently it allows to show ancestors of a family (both husband and wife), and
you can set how many generations do you want to see, and also for how many
generations you want to include sibling families as well:

(But the tool can be easily extended to support other scenarios as well.)

== LibreOffice Draw GEDCOM import filter

The `libreoffice/` subdirectory contains a LibreOffice extension, that
implements a GEDCOM import filter for Draw. Needless to say, it uses `ged2dot`
internally -- think of it as a GUI for `ged2dot`, with the additional benefit
that you can hand-edit the resulting layout in Draw, if you want.

Its dependencies:

- It uses Graphviz to process the `dot` format. In case you don't have Graphviz
  installed:

  * For Windows, http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php[get it here] (2.34 is tested).

  * For Linux, use your package manager to install the `graphviz` package (2.28 is tested).

- We depend on LibreOffice >= 4.2 RC1 because
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39206[fdo#39206] is not fixed in
  earlier versions.

Features:

- Filter detection: you can use File -> Open and select a GEDCOM file, and
  it'll be opened in Draw automatically.
- Import options: On import, a graphical dialog can be used to set a subset of
  the options available in a `ged2dotrc`.
- Internally reuses the excellent SVG import filter of LibreOffice, contributed
  by Fridrich Strba and Thorsten Behrens, so the result can be manually
  fine-tuned if necessary.
- Runs on Windows and Linux.

You can grap a release binary at the
http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/gedcom[LibreOffice
Extensions] site -- more on how to to install a LibreOffice extension
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Documentation/HowTo/install_extension[here].

Once that's done, you'll see something like this if you open a GEDCOM file:

== Bugs

For `ged2dot`, in case a given input results in a runtime crash, please open
https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/new[a new issue] on GitHub, including
an URL to your input.

For the LibreOffice extension, in case you get an error during opening:

- For Windows, the log file location is something like:

----
C:/Users/John/Application Data/LibreOffice/4/user/Scripts/python/log.txt
----

- For Linux, start LibreOffice from a terminal, the log is printed to the
  standard error.

In both cases, please open a new issue, including the log contents in addition
to the input.

in case placeholders have to be used for missing images.
