== Editing the source code

The source code is written in Python, so use whatever editor you're comfortable
with to edit it. Modefiles for VIM are included, patches welcome to add Emacs
ones.

== Testing your changes

It is recommended that you do not install the development version of the
extension to your system profile, as sooner or later you will screw it up,
losing your "production" settings.

Instead, set up the official binaries in a separate dir, and create a dedicated profile as documented here:

http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Installing_in_parallel#Step_4_-_Optional.2C_but_Recommended_when_Testing:_Changing_the_User_Profile_location

Then you can use something like:

----
make -s install UNOPKG_PREFIX=$HOME/git/libreoffice/lo73/opt/libreoffice7.3/program/
----

To package and install your changes in a few seconds, with a single
command. (It is recommended that you kill soffice.bin before install.)

// vim: ft=asciidoc
