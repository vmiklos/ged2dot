ged2dot tries to produce good layout by not trusting graphviz to do all the positioning, but does a
lot of work to provide good hints for positioning. This is nice, but it does not scale: as the
family tree grows, you keep running into edge cases which break these positioning hints.

"ged2dot core" tries hard to not provide any positioning hints, but just keep it simple: both
individuals and families are graph nodes and we just do a depth-limited BFS and throw the result on
graphviz.

Time will tell if the original 2013 version or this newer approach will work better for large
graphs. Obviously heavily work in progress.
