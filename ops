The error message says that you don't have a config, thought I agree you could get a nicer error message when that happens. :-)\n\nSee `test/screenshotrc` for an example, you can copy that as `ged2dotrc` to the root of the repo and tweak it. My own `ged2dotrc` for an ancestry.com-based gedcom input is like:\n\n````\n[ged2dot]\n# Input GEDCOM file.\ninput = test.ged\n# Root family.\nrootFamily = F24\n# Number of ancestor generations to show.\nlayoutMaxDepth = 3\n````\n\nYou probably want to change rootFamily to be the family of your home person. And either change test.ged to the filename you got from ancestry or rename the file to test.ged and place it at the root of the repo. Hope this helps. :-)","files":null}]}
