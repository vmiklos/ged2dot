The error message says that you don't have a config, thought I agree you could get a nicer error message when that happens. :-)\n\nSee `test/screenshotrc` for an example, you can copy that as `ged2dotrc` to the root of the repo and tweak it. My own `ged2dotrc` for an ancestry.com-based gedcom input is like:\n\n````\n[ged2dot]\n# Input GEDCOM file.\ninput = test.ged\n# Root family.\nrootFamily = F24\n# Number of ancestor generations to show.\nlayoutMaxDepth = 3\n````\n\nYou probably want to change rootFamily to be the family of your home person. And either change test.ged to the filename you got from ancestry or rename the file to test.ged and place it at the root of the repo. Hope this helps. :-)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ab936a8713094070caec5c39dc6d9690af06fb58"},"timestamp":1577198499,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2ODc2MDAzOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/13#issuecomment-568760039"},"message":"I played around with it, trying to get it to NOT move people too far away\nfrom when they should be, but after 3 generations, it's totally impossible\nto control the dot algorithm that tried to shorten lines.\n\nIt's also confused by cousins marrying, which is quite common up to 100\nyears ago (1920s in my case) so that limits how far back a tree is\npossible.
