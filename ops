If you read the doc of those config keys:\n\n\u003e layoutMaxSiblingDepth: Number of ancestor generations, where also sibling spouses are shown.\n\nand\n\n\u003e layoutMaxSiblingFamilyDepth: Number of ancestor generations, where also sibling families are shown.\n\nSo even if you set these to 0, they only influence ancestor generations, not the generation of the root family. I'll add a separate config option for this, since altering the meaning of the existing ones would be confusing, but the use-case makes sense to me.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1579266084,"nonce":"6WUvhxisxkMgfEGHW/zjZo1BZ7M=","added":null,"removed":["need-info"]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1579266084,"nonce":"6Z4Udm8HgZIj/P7IxQSwutBQpTM=","added":["enhancement"],"removed":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1579292382,"nonce":"MSG7v8SEIXDXPkX8c05Psd9/E9w=","message":"Greg goes away when the new option is used, see the testcase -\u003e closing.
