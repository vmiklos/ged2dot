Then replace sensitive data in the minimal reproducer with mock data, finally attach it here.\n\nRe the second problem, please attach a reproducer for that as well, it sounds not too complicated to support custom image paths.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"0f8cc43527ac7e18e638da5c7831613085a25cfb"},"timestamp":1591821595,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0MzEzNzgxMjQ="},"added":["need-info"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"0f8cc43527ac7e18e638da5c7831613085a25cfb"},"timestamp":1609685215,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MzYyODA5Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/20#issuecomment-753628096"},"message":"I've tested that the default options can open both files with current ge2dot master. As for your images, you need to place images of people with a filename \"Givenname Familyname YYYY.jpg\" in a directory, then use --imagedir to refer to that directory. If you use a relative path, it'll be relative to the GEDCOM file.
