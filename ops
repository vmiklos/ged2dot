Sorry, I dont know how to open a pull request. But I just noticed that I can upload/attach ZIP files. Below you can find the patch and the image files I mentioned. Regarding my points above, my patch should cover:\n\nProper fix for \n- (1) Horizontal stretch with PDFs\n- (3) Text in SVGs not centered\n\nQuick and dirty fix for \n- (2) Hard coded paths in SVG. You still need to adapt \"image_dir\", I didn't to that in my patch as I didn't need it. Also, it might make sense to have a command line option that toggles this together with the next point\n- (5) Use SVG instead of PNG\n- (6) Use \"splines\". It might make sense to have this as a command line option to chose either ortho or splines\n\nNot addressed:\n- (4) Different handling of years\n\n[patch_and_images.zip](https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/files/6644724/patch_and_images.zip)","files":null}]}
