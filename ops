I assume you will want to anonymize it first.\n\nIf you want a quick workaround: try to reduce the scope of the nodes you want to layout, infinite amount of nodes are not possible to lay out in general sadly. (The graph has to be a planar graph, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph for details.)\n\nBut who knows, perhaps your specific problem is more about ged2dot is lame, and it's not about a theoretical limit. :-)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ab936a8713094070caec5c39dc6d9690af06fb58"},"timestamp":1555793968,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTE3MDkwOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/12#issuecomment-485170908"},"message":"Thanks for your help!\nMay I just send/email you a GED file instead of putting it into Github?

Using '1', it's clean (almost... there's a couple of stray connection ovals that you were prob'ly using for debuggery).\n\nThere IS a loop -- my grandparents were first cousins. Their common ancestor is in the file but it's not in the first 2 generations from the selected root family.
