In your sample e.g. F6000000052439790907 is a valid family identifier. It's up to you to decide who should be the central family. (By default children from that family and various ancestors are shown in the dot output.) You can change \"F1\" to anything else in your ged2dotrc, in the rootFamily key.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"0f8cc43527ac7e18e638da5c7831613085a25cfb"},"timestamp":1559339750,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5Nzg3MjM2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/issues/6#issuecomment-497872369"},"message":"Nothing actionable here in almost 2 years, closing.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"0f8cc43527ac7e18e638da5c7831613085a25cfb"},"timestamp":1559339750,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4MjIzNzkzOQ=="},"status":2}]}
