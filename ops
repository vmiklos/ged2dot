Then replace sensitive data in the minimal reproducer with mock data, finally attach it here.\n\nRe the second problem, please attach a reproducer for that as well, it sounds not too complicated to support custom image paths.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1591821595,"nonce":"HZjgxEqiROymUMNx/gTci+f0epw=","added":["need-info"],"removed":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1609685215,"nonce":"XvzI9P1gyUy7TWmj06q5jLSCSRo=","message":"I've tested that the default options can open both files with current ge2dot master.
