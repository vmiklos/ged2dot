When printing large posters of the family trees, the PNG images don't look very good. I created SVG ones, feel free to include them. However, creating PNG (i.e. dot -Tpng ...) might not work out of the box in some distributions if the images are SVG, so you might consider having a command line option to switch between PNG and SVG.
