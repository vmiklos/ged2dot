Using '1', it's clean (almost... there's a couple of stray connection ovals that you were prob'ly using for debuggery).\n\nThere IS a loop -- my grandparents were first cousins. Their common ancestor is in the file but it's not in the first 2 generations from the selected root family.  I may just edit the GED file to see if that's the cause.","files":null}]}
