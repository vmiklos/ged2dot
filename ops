Years are always displayed in the form \"YYYY-YYYY\", even if one of the years is missing. I would suggest having \"*YYYY\" or \"† YYYY\" if only one year is available. I didn't create a patch for this.\n\nHmm, so bare YYYY is a bit confusing, and e.g. ancestry.com also uses YYYY- to indicate that the death date is not known. But the \"† YYYY\" notation when only the death date is known makes sense, let me do that.","files":null}]}
