So you say graphviz is 32bit, your Windows is 64bit, what is the bitness of LibreOffice?\n\nAgreed, best to search in both paths.\n\nPlease test 0.8 (see releases here on GitHub), it is meant to fix compat problems with newer LibreOffice.\n\nI'll try to reproduce this 32bit graphviz thing on 64bit Windows, I don't expect it's too hard to fix this.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1559339451,"nonce":"ke21t44FFQXKSB9RkY2q5DNGiz0=","message":"https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/commit/bdcf19b30ce1f44bd111adfa9514bf3f2e6cb865 fixes this.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"52aac070d062d8a9604ccd863dbee5075ce3953362cc663dba8250e59bc6b0fa"},"timestamp":1559339451,"nonce":"rpgi0QCk2QlmvMECXRqRUQ93g5o=","status":2}]}
