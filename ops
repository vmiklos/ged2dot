General input/ouput failure\" message. Unless I choose less than 7 generations. Same file opens smoothingly on Android phone with FamilyGem version 0.7.12, http://www.familygem.app and https://github.com/michelesalvador/FamilyGem\nPlatform is Ubuntu GNU-Linux 18.04 LTS, LibreOffice 6.0.7.3, LibreOffice Draw GEDCOM import filter 0.7 and graphviz version 2.40.1-2\nGEDCOM file version is 5.5.1 and was created by GRAMPS version 4.2.8. File size is 808kB\nI tried both, first opening Draw and rigth-click the gedcom file and choose \"Open with Draw\". Same general failure message.\nI tried to reproduce this with the following torture files from https://www.tamurajones.net/ but was not able to. Maybe this is related to the number of generations. These are large files with only 2 generations:\nhttps://www.tamurajones.net/downloads/ThreeTortureTests1.5/Married1200.ged\nhttps://www.tamurajones.net/downloads/Siblings0.1.5/Siblings1200.ged\n\n2) Images are correctly referenced in gedcom file in the way \"./MEDIA/imagefile.jpg\".\ngedcom file and MEDIA folder are in the same folder at opening, and FamilyGem opens over 700 images in a rush with same setup.\nI guess this is related to the relative pathfile: \"./whatever\".","files":null}]}
