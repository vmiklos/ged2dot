# Introduction

ged2dot is a GEDCOM to Graphviz converter.

The latest version is v7.5, released on 2023-02-01.

## Description

`ged2dot` is a script that takes a [GEDCOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) file and tries to
visualize it using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)'s `dot` tool. The basic idea is that you can
map individuals and families to graph nodes and connections between them to graph edges, then `dot`
takes care of the rest. What's unique about `ged2dot` is that it allows more than showing ancestors
and descendants of a single individual (what you can easily do with other existing family editor
software).

It looks like this:
